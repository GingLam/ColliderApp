# Colliders in Epidemiology: A Shiny App  
* Paradoxical associations between and outcome and exposure are common in epidemiological studies from observational data.  
*  A collider is a variable that is causally influenced by an exposure and an outcome.
* Controlling in multivariable analyses for a collider can introduce a spurious association between its causes (exposure and outcome).  
*  Using Directed Acyclic Graphs based on substantial clinical knowledge helps identifying colliders.    
*  Whether or not to adjust for a collider will depend on the main analytical interest i.e. predictive modeling approaches will condition on it to increase predictive accuracy while explicative modeling approaches will not condition on it to prevent bias.
